    "In this project we will develop a transformer architecture equipped only with an encoder structure to do the task of sentiment analysis. For this model we will use a dataset of 1500 customer feedbacks; the model reaches an accuracy of ~99% on the training dataset and ~90% on the testing dataset after approximately 500 iterations. Alternatively, we start training the model with a very small dataset of 100 customer feedbacks. The word tokens are mapped to GloVe word embeddings and the accuracy of the model reaches ~90% and ~92% on the training and testing datasets after 100 iterations respectively. "

The texts were blurred and when you zoom it out it's pixelated. I thought this issue only occurs on mobile apps however it was also present on the website. Please fix this. I still remember the time when I can export high definition texts and I love that experience. Thank you!\n",

I just came here to thank the developers for this beautiful app and its facilities. I literally find almost everything that I need for and the best part is even without the premium feature it provides us with a lot many facilities. I love it! Thank you..! ❤\n",

Moreover when I want my files to be saved it gets stuck at the downloading screen (where your so called magic does not happen) For now you'll be getting 1 stars from me.

I'm only rating 2 stars because they keep taking features away from the free version and putting them behind a subscription wall rather than creating new features or adding new fonts and graphics to premium. I also feel that the subscription price of 12.99/mo is pretty steep for someone that isn't using it for a business every single day and only wants a handful of fonts.\n",

    "Conclusion: The model reaches ~98% accuracy on the training dataset and ~90% accuracy on the testing set with only 600 iterations taking less than 5 minutes to compute. As compared to a simple Recurrent Neural Network, in which the accuracy on the training dataset did not surpass 70%, this is a very good progress. Also note that in some cases when the model prediction is labeled as wrong, the comment itself is quite confusing and might not be the result of the model incapability to understand the task of sentiment analysis. A better approach would have been to introduce 3 labels instead of 2. "
