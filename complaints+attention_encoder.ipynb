I chated with a representative after logging into my account regarding my opitions to ensure I protect my credit and bring my account current. \\n\\nShe advised me that before an extenstion could be done, I had to make a payment in the amount of {$270.00}. I reviewed my finances, as I am playing catch up on all my bills and made this payment on Monday XX/XX/XXXX. This rep advised me, once this payment posts to my account to contact Ally back for an extention or to have a payment deffered to the end of my loan. \\n\\nWith this in mind, I contacted Ally again today and chatted with XXXX. I explained all of the above and the information I was provided when I chatted with the rep last week. She asked several questions and advised me that a one or two month  extension/deffered payment could be done however partial payment is needed! WHAT? She advised me {$230.00} or there abouts would be due within 10 days from me accepting the agreement and then the remaining bal of {$150.00} or there abouts would be due in XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, my payments of {$380.00} per month would resume. \\n\\nIf this was the case, I SHOULD HAVE JUST BEEN OFFERED THIS WHEN I JUST MADE MY PAYMENT so that I could catch up on my bills. \\n\\nThis company was working with XXXX in New Jersey which has since closed most likely due to illegal practices, they changed my loan company to this company after I had signed paperwork for another, kill you with interest rates and has NEVER once considered refiancing my vechile for a lower interest rate ( due to the age of the vechile other companies will not take it ) and THEY DO NOT WORK WITH YOU!'"

We then take a weighted average of all class precisions. Same calculation will be done for recall. But note that if false positive is more important for us, meaning that hte model thinks it belongs but if fact it doesn't, then precision will be more important. If false negatives are more important, we will focus more on the recall value. "
